It was a table view that showed items from an array shoppingList, and I used a UIAlertController with a text field to let users enter free text that got appended to the array. That forms the foundation of this app – if users enter some text, app assumes it’s a real product and adds it to their list.

I also added a left bar button item, that clears the shopping list – afterwards table view reloads all its data;         
Right bar button item, that adds items into user's shopping list;           
Toolbar item, that calls the action to format the list, and present UIActivityViewController to share the shopping list.

What I have mastered:

⦿ UITableViewController     
⦿ UIToolbar      
⦿ Showing and describing errors       
⦿ UIActivityViewController         
⦿ UIAlertController
